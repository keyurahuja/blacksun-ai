You: Hey there! Ever wondered how climate change affects biodiversity?

You: It’s like the invisible infrastructure behind our ecosystems! But how does it really work?

Me: Great question! Imagine biodiversity as the web of life on Earth—genes, bacteria, plants, animals—all interconnected.

You: So, how is climate change involved?

Me: Climate change has altered ecosystems worldwide. Higher temperatures force species to move, affecting entire food chains.

You: Ah, like animals and plants relocating due to warming?

Me: Exactly! Some head toward the poles or higher elevations, disrupting ecosystems and risking extinction.

You: And what about the oceans?

Me: Rising temperatures threaten marine ecosystems. Coral reefs, for instance, have nearly halved in 150 years.

You: So, climate change impacts health too?

Me: Absolutely! It shifts plant, animal, and virus distributions, affecting human settlements and health.

You: Why is biodiversity crucial for limiting climate change?

Me: Biodiversity absorbs carbon emissions, maintains stable ecosystems, and provides food, medicine, and livelihoods.

You: Thanks for unraveling the climate-biodiversity connection! Now I feel like a conservation enthusiast!
